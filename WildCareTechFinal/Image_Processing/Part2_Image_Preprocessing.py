# Image Preprocessing: In this step, the acquired images are prepared for further analysis by removing noise, correcting for distortions, and enhancing the image quality. Operations like image resizing, color space conversion, and filtering techniques (e.g., smoothing, sharpening) are applied to improve the image's visual appearance and facilitate subsequent processing steps.
